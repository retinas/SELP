Enrollment rates of primary and secondary schools are quite low in some geographical locations. According to Primary Education Data reported by Unicef indicates that the lowest and acute enrollment rate examples are; Somalia %76, South Sudan %74, Liberia %57. The lost-generation danger is threatening our global society.

Thanks to the contributions of all shareholders, out of school numbers are decreased 99 M to 59M. However, according to Unicef, the progress has been stalled since 2007 for various reasons.

There is also refugee education crisis in the world.Our country (Turkey) is home to 1.3 Million child refugees; it makes us the top child refugee-hosting country in the world. In the refugee society enrollment rate for the school is %56 in Turkey.

We would like to help, contribute and accelerate this layover by innovating and developing a new way of open source technological solution. This is why we begin to develop VR based Social and Emotional Learning Platform.
