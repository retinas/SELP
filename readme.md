Lifelong and sustainable learning is the important asset. Thanks to technological improvements there are various ways to implement these ideas in our lives. It changes the way of how we learn, experience and contribute.

Conventionally the term "school" generally related to literacy and numeracy based skills at first. However, there are much more important skills that we need to teach young generations to adopt the progress-based approach for creating peaceful, effective and civilized society.

Critical thinking, arousing curiosity, and collaborative way of togetherness are such an example of it.
Our platform is presenting that can be improbable, scalable and accessible from all over the world. In regardless of their geography, their vulnerability and background.

Immersive and interactive virtual environments with task-based scenarios will prepare them to desired skills that required at the 21st-century internationally. So we are planning to eliminate that disadvantageous position and helping them to contribute their society.

Enrollment rates of primary and secondary schools are quite low in some geographical locations. According to Primary Education Data reported by Unicef indicates that the lowest and acute enrollment rate examples are; Somalia %76, South Sudan %74, Liberia %57. The lost-generation danger is threatening our global society.

We would like to democratize the accessibility of social and emotional education for all children.

There is also refugee education crisis in the world.Our country (Turkey) is home to 1.3 Million child refugees; it makes us the top child refugee-hosting country in the world. In the refugee society enrollment rate for the school is %56 in Turkey.

We would like to help, contribute and accelerate this layover by innovating and developing a new way of open source technological solution. This is why we begin to develop VR based Social and Emotional Learning Platform.
